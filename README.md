# miner-starting-batch
Starts miner and runs for specified time then gives computer a break and starts again.
When started press '2' to continue and '1' to kill before opening anything.
Press 'y' while it is running and it will kill the miner and close the cmdline that this file opens.
Replace file path and task name to make program work for your miner or other software.










The playsongwhenthisstarts will play a mp3 file when you start it. I have it set to start Rainbow Six Siege and play Danger Zone through the loading proccess then kill the song at the end. To make it work for you place song file name in and the path to it. Also replace the path for my game with yours and change the start.
